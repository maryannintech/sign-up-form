# Project: Sign-Up Form

This fake sign up form is part of the curriculum of The Odin Project, in the intermediate HTML and CSS course. The layout I followed is [provided](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png) by TOP. I tried my best to apply what I previously learned about forms and I pay close attention to accessibility practices. I made a fake company name because I find it more enjoyable than having dummy texts in my projects.
